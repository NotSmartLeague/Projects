## Description
A simple C++ calculator that takes two numbers and performs basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
This project was completed in about 20 minutes, without any significant challenges.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/NotSmartLeague/C-Projects.git
    ```

## Usage
The usage of this calculator is straightforward:

1. Insert the first number
2. Insert the second number
3. Specify the operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
4. Get the result (hopefully)

## Testing
A few manual tests were performed, covering basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. A specific case tested was division by zero, where the program successfully handled the error by notifying the user.

To manually test the program, simply run it and input various numbers and operations.

## Difficulty & Evaluation
Haven't found any difficulties, I went straight on the keyboard and everything worked fine.
Only googled for switch statement syntax clarification.
