## Description
It's just a Rock,Paper-Scissor console game. Not very funny to implement.
I've learn how to handle wrong user input and how to project the entire game.

## Installation


## Usage
Just compile and execute. Just make your choose and duel against the pc.


## Testing
I have manually tested all the single functions, but I still have to test the main function properly.


## Difficulty & Evaluation
Very boring to implement but I've found any struggle beside googling how to handle wrong user input.

## Contributing 
Just me

## License
No license :(((
